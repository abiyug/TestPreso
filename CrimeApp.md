What is Crime Analyzer Shiny Web App?
========================================================
transition: zoom
* Crime Analyzer web application provides graphically detailed insight for crime analysis in a large metropolitan area. 
* The application comes loaded with Huston Police crime dataset from January 2010 to August 2010, but datasets from other metropolitan areas can be loaded. 
* The application loads violent crime by type, by month or by  a combination of both. 
* Each crime type is depicted with different color pallet. 
* The crime location is geocoded and is displayed on a map in the exact spot where the crime took place.
